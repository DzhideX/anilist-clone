This is a feature clone of the Anilist.co web app that works on the root and all anime/[id] routes. This was made for the purpose of learning new technologies and is fully responsive.

<strong>Technologies I used:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>React.js</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Next.js</strong></li>
  <li><strong>GraphQL</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Styled-JSX</strong>  (first time encountering a CSS-in-JS library since my last React Native project)</li>
</ul>

<strong>To run on your own device:</strong>

<ol>
  <li> Download the project</li>
  <li>Run npm install in the project directory</li>
  <li> Run this command: <em>npm run dev</em></li>
  <li>Open <strong>http://localhost:3000</strong> with your browser to see the result.</li> 
  </ol>
