This is a feature clone of the Anilist.co web app that works on the root and all anime/[id] routes. This was made for the purpose of learning new technologies and is fully responsive.

<strong>Technologies I used:</strong>

<ul>
  <li>React.js</li>
  <li>Next.js</li>
  <li>GraphQL</li>
  <li>Styled-JSX (first time encountering a CSS-in-JS library since my last React Native project)</li>
</ul>
